        "  2. **Hero Section**: A full-width hero with a bold headline incorporating '{product_name}', a subheadline based on '{product_description}', and a prominent call-to-action (CTA) button (e.g., \"Get Started\" or \"Learn More\").\n",

        "  - Ensure clean typography using web-safe fonts (e.g., Roboto, Open Sans, or Arial).\n",
        "  - Apply smooth hover effects on buttons and links (e.g., scale, color transitions).\n",
        "  - Use CSS flexbox or grid for layout, ensuring responsiveness across mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), and desktop (1024px+).\n",
        "  - Add subtle animations (e.g., fade-in, scale) using CSS transitions (no JavaScript).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Responsiveness**: The design must adapt seamlessly to all screen sizes, with mobile-first styling.\n",
